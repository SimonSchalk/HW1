Homework assignment 1 - leapyear

This project make it possible to check, if any year is a leapyear or not. 
The function “Schaltjahr” check if a free chosen year is a leap year or not. 
It is a leap year if the Number can be divided by 4 and 400 or divided by 4 and not 100. 
All other years are no leap years. 
The python code prints “Schaltjahr” if it is a leap year and “Kein Schaltjahr” if it is not a leap year.
